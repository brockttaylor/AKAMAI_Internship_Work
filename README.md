taucamServ and taugrab work as a server and client respectively to capture images from a FLIR Tau 2 infrared camera and service them to the CFHT network. 
Likewise, zwocamServ and zwograb do the same for a ZWO ASI 178 mm astronomy all-sky visible-light camera. 
taucamLocal was an experiment early on in the project to become familiar with the framework.
